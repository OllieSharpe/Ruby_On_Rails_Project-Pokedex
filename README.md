# Ruby on Rails project - Pokedex

This application sorts the current pokemon, entered in its corresponding SQL database, by their generation and display multiple details about them to the user. This includes information, such as: stats, types, name, generation and evolution information. The app allows for an admin user to edit and add new entries to the database via the site. The majority of the data is added via PokeAPI with the admin only being required to give the pokemon id and two fields not included in the API. The app uses JavaScript to render stat bars of a size proportional to the individual pokemon's stat. It also allows the user to transition between shiny and non-shiny sprites via an eventlistener.

The app is currently deployed on heroku at: https://frozen-island-22261.herokuapp.com

Struggles:
This project had multiple requirements which required self-learning, across it's 3 day duration, such as deploying the site to heroku, populating the database via an API etc. I took this project as an opportunity to learn and develop these new techniques as a priority and as such, little time was given to styling the website beyond the basics. In future I plan to use time-boxing more in order to cap my time spent on unknown problems and free up more time to work on the sites presentation.

Sprint 2:
For sprint 2, I plan on developing the presentation of the site more. I would also like to include some additional JavaScript functionality to generated background colours for the show pages based on the pokemon types.
